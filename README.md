# Steel Industry Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview

This collaborative project by Kushagra, Adhithya, and Jacob explores energy consumption patterns in the steel industry using data from Gwangyang, South Korea's DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Handled missing values for a clean dataset.

### Data Exploration
- Analyzed dataset characteristics.
- Explored trends using visualizations.

### Data Visualization
- Used various techniques (bar graphs, scatter plots, treemaps) to illustrate trends.
- Explored energy consumption, power factors, and CO2 emissions.

## Findings

1. **Weekly Energy Consumption:**
   - Weekdays exhibit higher energy consumption than weekends.
   - Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday show the highest energy demand.

2. **Reactive Power Analysis:**
   - Explored lagging and leading power factors for different load types.
   - Maximum load demonstrated the highest leading power factor.

3. **Load Type Analysis:**
   - Treemap visualization revealed that maximum load consumes the most energy.

4. **Weekday vs. Weekend Analysis:**
   - Stacked bar graphs depict variations in energy consumption for weekdays and weekends.
   - Weekdays show higher energy usage compared to weekends.

5. **CO2 Emissions:**
   - CO2 emissions were highest in August due to increased energy demand during hot weather.

6. **Monthly Energy Usage:**
   - August displayed the highest energy usage, attributed to South Korea's hot climate.

7. **Power Factor Comparison:**
   - Treemaps illustrate power factors, with maximum load having the highest leading factor.

## Conclusion

This analysis sheds light on crucial aspects of energy consumption in the steel industry. Insights into weekly patterns, load types, CO2 emissions, and power factors provide valuable information for optimizing energy usage.
